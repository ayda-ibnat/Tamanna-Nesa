<h1>My Mom</h1>
<h1 id="name">Tamanna Dipu</h1>
<h2 id="intro">My mom is an amazing mom. Always trying to lighten the mood with her positive energy. 4 words that discribe my mom best are "Life of the party." She's always going out of her way to help others succeed. She never gives up and asks for help if she needs it. she pushes people to work their best and pushes people out of their comfortzone. That's a good this because she encourages people to discover new things. She never takes no for an answer because she's just that positive.</h2>

<h1>Her Current Job</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<h2>As Said before, My mom likes to help people. Little do people know that's actually what she does. She helps people find jobs. She's always talking on the phone booking appointments for random people. The ammount of courage she has. My social skills could never. My mom works at Achēv. Achēv is a non-profit organization (whatever that is). My mo is very good at her job. She's always calm with her clients and helps them with all their questions. I'm not sure how she's that calm with her clients. From what i've heard, they sound pretty annoying. </h2>

<h2>Here is Achēv's page:</h2>

<h1>How she spends time with family</h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<h2>My mom actually has a second job. When she's not working she's either doing the treadmill or spending time with her family. She cooks awesome food for us but not all the time. So when she makes food she makes a lot and it's really tasty. She's also doing activities with us and suggesting her ideas of how to spend the time.</h2>
<h3>Here is the channel she follows (she adds her own stuff sometimes):</h3>
